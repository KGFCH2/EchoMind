# 🤖 EchoMind — Complete User Guide & Documentation

> Everything you need to know about how my voice assistant works, what it can do, and how I built it.

## 🎙️ How It Feels to Use

When I run EchoMind, it greets me based on the time of day and immediately starts listening. I speak naturally, and it responds — either by performing an action (opening an app, searching the web) or by answering my question using its AI brain (powered by **Gemini** or **Groq**). Here's what I see in my terminal:

```text
Speaking: Good evening! I am EchoMind, your voice assistant. How can I help you?
Listening...
You said: open chrome
Speaking: Opening chrome
Speaking: I am listening to you.... please tell me what to do next
Listening...
```

* **👁️ Visual Feedback**: I always know what's happening — "Speaking...", "Listening...", "You said: ..." appear in real time.
* **🗣️ Smart Follow-up**: After performing specific actions (like opening an app or playing music), my assistant says *"I am listening to you.... please tell me what to do next"* so I know it's ready for the next task. For general questions, it stays silent and waits in the background.
* **🔄 Non-Blocking**: Even when I switch to Chrome or YouTube, EchoMind keeps listening in the background. It never stops.
* **😊 Personality**: I can say "Hello", "Thank you", or ask personal questions. It responds warmly.

## 📝 Document & File Writing

This is one of my favorite features. I can open Notepad or Word and have the AI generate and type content for me automatically.

### ✍️ Creating a New Document

* *"Open notebook and write a story about a dragon."* 📄
* *"Open word and write a poem about nature."* 📄

### 📑 Adding More Content to the Same Document

If my document is already open, I don't need to say "open" again. I just say:

* *"In the **current** notepad, write a Bengali song."*
* *"Write a poem about love in the notepad."*

My assistant will automatically add a **5-line gap** before the new content so each piece stays visually separated.

### 🌍 Unicode & Multi-Language Support

I built a special clipboard method using PowerShell so that **Bengali**, **Hindi**, and other non-English scripts display perfectly. Earlier, characters were invisible because `pyautogui.typewrite()` only supports ASCII. Now it copies via clipboard and pastes — works flawlessly.

### 🎶 Accurate Song Lyrics

When I ask for a specific song (e.g., *"Write the Bole Chudiyan song from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"*), my assistant sends a research-focused prompt to the AI, requesting the **actual lyrics** instead of generating random text.

## 🚀 Application & Window Management

### 📥 Opening Apps

* *"Open Chrome"*, *"Launch Notepad"*, *"Start Word"*, *"Open Camera"*.

### 📤 Closing Apps & Tabs

I improved the closing logic so it handles specific scenarios properly:

* *"Close Chrome"* — Terminates the entire Chrome process.
* *"Close Camera"* — Kills the Windows Camera app specifically.
* *"Close YouTube"* — Smart enough to close just the YouTube **tab**, not the whole browser.
* *"Close the current tab"* / *"Close this tab"* — Sends Ctrl+W to close whatever tab is active.

### 📑 Browser Tab Navigation

I can navigate between my open browser tabs completely hands-free:

* *"Next tab"* — Moves to the right tab (Ctrl+Tab). ➡️
* *"Previous tab"* — Moves to the left tab (Ctrl+Shift+Tab). ⬅️
* *"Move to 1st tab"* / *"Go to 3rd tab"* — Jumps directly (Ctrl+1, Ctrl+3). 🔢
* *"Go to last tab"* — Jumps to the final tab (Ctrl+9). 🔚

### 📂 System Folders & Drives

* *"Open Desktop"*, *"Open Downloads"*, *"Open Documents"*.
* *"Open Drive C"* / *"Open Drive D"*.
* *"Eject Drive E"* — Safely ejects external drives.

---

## 🌐 Web, Music & Search

### 🔍 Web Search

* *"Search for Python tutorials on Chrome"*
* *"Google latest news"*

### 🏏 Live Cricket Scores

* *"Live cricket score"*
* *"Cricket match score"*

### 🎵 Music & YouTube

### 🔔 Smart Reminders

EchoMind can act as your personal assistant for tasks and time-sensitive alerts:

* *"Remind me at 9:48 PM"* — Sets a precise reminder. ⏰
* *"What are my reminders?"* — Lists all active pending reminders. 📋
* *"Cancel reminder for 10:00 PM"* — Removes a specific reminder from the list. 🗑️

## 🏗️ The EchoMind Architecture: Full Documentation

I designed EchoMind with a modular, **handler-based architecture**. This means every feature is isolated in its own file, making the system easy to update and debug.

### 📂 1. Project Root Directories

* **`clients/`**: Contains the AI service wrappers that connect EchoMind to external LLMs (Large Language Models).
* **`config/`**: Stores global configuration settings, environment variables, and platform-specific mappings.
* **`handlers/`**: The "Muscle" of the project. Contains over 25 individual modules that perform specific actions on your system.
* **`utils/`**: The "Senses" and "Nerves." Contains helper scripts for voice input/output, logging, and data formatting.
* **`logs/`**: Automatically generated folder that stores your interaction history in `.jsonl` format for later review.
* **`models/`**: (Optional/Hidden) Stores offline machine learning models (like Vosk) for offline speech recognition.

---

### 📄 2. Root Files (The Core)

* **`main.py`**: The brain of the assistant. It initializes all components, starts background threads, and contains the main loop that routes your voice to the correct handler. 🎛️
* **`.env`**: (Hidden) Stores your secret API keys (Gemini, Groq, Weather, Cricket). This file is ignored by Git for security. 🔑
* **`.env.example`**: A template file showing you what keys you need to add to your own `.env` file. 📑
* **`.gitignore`**: Tells Git which files to ignore (like `.env`, `__pycache__`, and `models/`) to keep the repository clean. 🚫
* **`.free_apis.md`**: (Hidden) A curated list of free APIs I discovered that can be used to add more live data to EchoMind. 🌐
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python libraries needed to run the project (e.g., `speechrecognition`, `pyautogui`, `sounddevice`). 📦
* **`README.md`**: The main landing page of the project with a high-level overview. 📖
* **`INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: This file! A comprehensive guide for users and developers. 📖
* **`FUTURE_FEATURES.md`**: A roadmap of what I plan to build next for EchoMind. 🚀
* **`LICENSE`**: The legal license (MIT) governing how this code can be used. ⚖️

* **`voice_io.py`**: The physical link to your hardware. It manages the Microphone (SoundDevice) and the Voice (TTsx3). 🎙️
* **`text_processing.py`**: Cleans up messy speech-to-text transcripts, adds punctuation, and converts symbols. 🧹
* **`time_utils.py`**: Small logic to determine if it's currently Morning, Afternoon, or Evening. 🕐

### 💡 Pro Tip

I power EchoMind with **Google Gemini** and **Groq** as its primary AI brains. If no local handler matches a command, it gets forwarded to one of these providers, making the assistant capable of answering virtually anything. 🚀
