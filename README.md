# EchoMind 🤖

> My AI-powered voice assistant that runs entirely from the terminal.

---

## ℹ️ About

I built **EchoMind** as a lightweight, modular AI voice assistant that lives in the terminal. It listens for my spoken commands, intelligently routes them to focused handler modules, and falls back to an LLM (Google Gemini) when a command isn't handled locally. My goal was to create a hands-free assistant that feels alive, stays responsive, and helps me control my entire computer with just my voice.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎙️ **Voice I/O** — I integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech so the assistant can hear me and talk back.
- 🧩 **Modular Handlers** — I organized the codebase into small, focused handler modules inside `handlers/` (time, date, weather, files, music, system controls, app management, and more).
- 🌐 **AI Fallback** — When no local handler matches, my assistant forwards the question to Google Gemini (or Groq as a backup) so it can answer virtually anything.
- 📝 **Smart Document Writing** — I can ask it to open Notepad or Word and write stories, poems, or even real song lyrics in any language, including Bengali and Hindi.
- 🔋 **Background Monitoring** — Battery level and USB device detection threads run silently in the background and alert me when something changes.
- ⌨️ **Global Hotkeys** — I set up F1 for the Emoji Picker and F5 for quick unmute.
- 🗣️ **Always Listening** — After every action, my assistant proactively says *"I am listening to you..."* so I never have to wonder if it's still active.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

I use a `.env` file to manage all my API keys and settings. Here are the important ones:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | My primary AI brain (Google Gemini). |
| `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` | The API endpoint for Gemini. |
| `GEMINI_API_STREAM` | Set to `true` for streaming responses. |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Backup AI provider (auto-fallback). |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | For real-time weather lookups. |

Example `.env` entry:

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
```

## 🌤️ Weather Information

I integrated OpenWeatherMap so I can ask about the weather in any city:

- *"What's the weather in London?"*
- *"Kolkata weather"*

To enable this, just set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in your `.env`. Temperatures are returned in Celsius by default.

## ▶️ Running EchoMind

Start my assistant from the project root:

```bash
python main_refactored.py
```

It will greet you, then listen in a continuous loop. Speak naturally — it handles the rest. For a full list of what you can say, check out my **[INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)** 📖.

## 📝 Logs

I log every interaction and error to the `logs/` directory (e.g., `logs/assistant.jsonl`) so I can review conversations and debug issues later.

## ❗ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Voice I/O fails | Make sure your microphone and speakers are connected and dependencies are installed. |
| Weather lookups fail | Verify that `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` is set and valid in your `.env`. |
| AI responses are missing | Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` are configured. |
| Bengali/Hindi text not showing | The clipboard method requires PowerShell on Windows. |
